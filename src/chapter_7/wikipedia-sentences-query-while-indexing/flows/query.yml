executors:                                        # the list of components in this Flow
  - name: query_encoder                           # the name of this executor. This one takes the text and transforms it into vectors to be used in searching
    uses: jinahub+docker://FlairTextEncoder       # we use a pre-built Executor docker image
    timeout_ready: -1                             # disable timing out. (downloading the image can take some time)
  - name: query_indexer                           # the name. This is a Compound Executor, formed of a vector searcher and a key-value db
    uses: jinahub+docker://FaissLMDBSearcher      # again, the docker image
    replicas: 2                                   # we want to replicate this executor, for better performance. This creates two identical copies. Requests are passed to either one
    timeout_ready: -1                             # disable timing out. (downloading the image can take some time)
